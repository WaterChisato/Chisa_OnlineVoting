Completely anonymous, voters cannot be viewed, and voting is only allowed from a single IP address.   
The management panel is simple and clear by default, with high openness. The default password is **114514**. You can delete a voting option, but you cannot modify the number of voters (which is also a fair mechanism for voting).
